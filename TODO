in progress
===========
- past executions in overview
- make GUI more robust against backend failures

functionality:
==============

- GUI:
  - GWT module integration
    - configure pax runner to run the stack via mvn pax:run
    - make sure development mode works well via mvn gwt:run
  - New execution
    - better labels / clearer steps
    - later: display total number of MDRs on collection selection
  - Overview
    - list of currently running executions
      - overall status (number of MDRs processed vs. total number of MDRs)
      - cancel execution button (with "are you sure" confirmation message)
    - list of N (10?) past executions
    - later: link to view with full history
  - Execution detail view (refreshed every N seconds)
    - steps / plugins (later: on click, detail of plugin)
    - tasks in queue per step

- orchestrator:
  - workflow bundles
  - command interface orchestrator:
    - pause
    - cancel
    - show status

- storage: MangoDB-based implementation

- core plugins:
  - meta data mapping / conversion
  - URL checker
  - thumbnail downloader
  - ...

- GUI:
  - OsgiManager in Apache Karaf / webconsole
  - GWT integration in Karaf Webconsole


design:
=======

- Execution & ActiveExecution: perhaps extend Execution instead and add a state enum to it?
  semantically, there is a difference between both of them, and from a functional perspective it would be good to be able
  to retrieve e.g. the ProgressMonitor for an execution, unless we give that responsibility to the Orchestrator itself?

- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

- prioritisation:
  - add priority level in the Request?
  - how to inform the orchestrator that a priority changed?

- rollback of an execution / request
  - for now, do not do a rollback, but do a clean


configuration:
==============
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations (mvn dependency:analyze)

testing:
========
- unit test for ProcessingContainer / parallel execution
- unit tests for the orchestration components (WorfklowProcessor, UIMOrchestrator, StepProcessor)
- write more integration tests now that we have them working
