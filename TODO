functionality:
==============

- GUI:
  - GWT module integration
    - integrate compiled javasource code via extension point (servlet)
      - wrapper for OSGi services through GWT RPC servlets

- orchestrator:
  - workflow bundles
  - command interface orchestrator:
    - pause
    - cancel
    - show status

- storage: MangoDB-based implementation

- core plugins:
  - meta data mapping / conversion
  - URL checker
  - thumbnail downloader
  - ...

- GUI:
  - OsgiManager in Apache Karaf / webconsole
  - GWT integration in Karaf Webconsole


design:
=======

- Execution & ActiveExecution: perhaps extend Execution instead and add a state enum to it?
  semantically, there is a difference between both of them, and from a functional perspective it would be good to be able
  to retrieve e.g. the ProgressMonitor for an execution, unless we give that responsibility to the Orchestrator itself?

- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

- prioritisation:
  - add priority level in the Request?
  - how to inform the orchestrator that a priority changed?

- rollback of an execution / request
  - for now, do not do a rollback, but do a clean


configuration:
==============
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations (mvn dependency:analyze)

testing:
========
- unit test for ProcessingContainer / parallel execution
- unit tests for the orchestration components (WorfklowProcessor, UIMOrchestrator, StepProcessor)
- write more integration tests now that we have them working
